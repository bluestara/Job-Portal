The project provides all the features for the support of Job portal. As it is the beta version all the features may not be included due to insufficient time so the functionalities may be limited. Our project satisfies what had mentioned in the project requirements. In future we will add some features like adding job by employer, updated password Hashing, template design, best search implementation with mobile applicable app.
